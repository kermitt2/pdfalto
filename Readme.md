**pdfalto** is a command line executable for parsing PDF files and producing structured XML representations of the PDF content in [ALTO](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto/blob/master/schema/alto.xsd) format, capturing in particular all the layout and style information of the PDF. 

**pdfalto** is initially a fork of [pdf2xml](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdf2xml), developed at XRCE, with modifications for robustness, addition of features, improved layout element detections, and output enhanced format in [ALTO](https://github.com/altoxml/documentation/wiki) (including in particular space information, useful for instance for further machine learning processing). It is based on the [Xpdf](http://www.xpdfreader.com/) library.  

The latest stable version is *0.4*. Working version (master) is *0.5*.

An Archlinux package for pdfalto is available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pdfalto/), thanks to @andreasbaumann. The build process described [below](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto#build) will create a portable standalone pdfalto executable that can be packaged with other tools without further installation requirements for the end-user. 

# Requirements

* compilers : clang 3.6 or gcc 4.9
* makefile generator : cmake 3.12.0
* fetching dependencies : wget

# Usage

General usage is as follow: 

```
Usage: pdfalto [options] <PDF-file> [<xml-file>]
  -f <int>                      : first page to convert
  -l <int>                      : last page to convert
  -verbose                      : display pdf attributes
  -noImage                      : do not extract Images (Bitmap and Vectorial)
  -outline                      : create an outline file xml
  -annotation                   : create an annotations file xml
  -noLineNumbers                : do not output line numbers added in manuscript-style textual documents
  -readingOrder                 : blocks follow the reading order
  -noText                       : do not extract textual objects (might be useful, but non-valid ALTO)
  -charReadingOrderAttr         : include TYPE attribute to String elements to indicate right-to-left reading order (might be useful, but non-valid ALTO)
  -fullFontName                 : fonts names are not normalized
  -nsURI <string>               : add the specified namespace URI
  -opw <string>                 : owner password (for encrypted files)
  -upw <string>                 : user password (for encrypted files)
  -filesLimit <int>             : limit of asset files be extracted
  -q                            : don't print any messages or errors
  -v                            : print version info
  -h                            : print usage information
  -help                         : print usage information
  --help                        : print usage information
  -?                            : print usage information
```

In addition to the [ALTO](https://github.com/altoxml/documentation/wiki) file describing the PDF content, the following files are generated:

* `_metadata.xml` file containing a pdf file metadata (generate metadata information in a separate XML file as ALTO schema does not support that).

* `_annot.xml` file containing a description of the annotations in the PDF (e.g. GOTO, external http links, ...) obtained with `-annotation` option

* `_outline.xml` file containing a possible PDF-embedded table of content (aka outline) obtained with `-outline` option

* `.xml_data/` subdirectory containing the vectorial (.vec) and bitmap images (.png) embedded in the PDF, this is generated by default - when the option `-noImage` is not present. This extraction slows down the process very significantly, so if no image is required, use the option `-noImage`. When the images are not extracted, image elements with layout properties still appear in the ALTO file, but they reference no extracted image files. 

## Extra script to get only text content

The goal of pdfalto is to extract all the content of a PDF, not just text, but also layout, style, font, vector graphics, embedded bitmap, annotation, metadata, and outline information. For convenience and debugging, we provide a simple XSLT to extract only the text content from the produced ALTO XML file. For instance, using `xsltproc` command line, the following outputs the text content only:

> xsltproc schema/alto2txt.xsl alto_file.xml

# Dependencies

Dependencies can be recompiled by running this [script](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto/blob/master/install_deps.sh)

> ./install_deps.sh

The script will download and build the dependencies unders `libs/` and the additional language support packages for xpdf under `languages/`. 

If necessary, see [compiling dependencies procedures](Dependencies_INSTALL.md) for further details.

##### Known issues 
([issue 41](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto/issues/41)) might occur while building, in this case you'll need to compile the dependencies before building pdflato.

# Build

* NOTE for windows : it's recommended to use Cygwin and install standard libraries (either for cland or gcc)
> git clone https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto.git && cd pdfalto

* Xpdf-4.03 is shipped as git submodule, to download it: 

> git submodule update --init --recursive

* Build pdfalto:

> cmake .

> make

The executable `pdfalto` is generated in the root directory. Additionally, this will create a static library for xpdf-4.03 at the following path `xpdf-4.03/build/xpdf/lib/libxpdf.a` and all the libraries and their respective subdirectory. 

To use the additional xpdf language support packages, the executable `pdfalto` comes with a config file `xpdfrc` and language resources installed under `languages/`. Both `xpdfrc` and `languages/` must be alongside the executable `pdfalto` to be used. To add `pdfalto` with these additional resources to a third party application (e.g. GROBID), move the executation together with these files: 

```
lopez@work:~$ ls my_pdfalto/
languages  pdfalto  xpdfrc
```

##### Known issues 
([issue #135](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto/issues/135)) on macOS "fontconfig.h file not found" might occur while building, see described workaround.

# Future work

- Text like containing block element characters (https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2B00.pdf) are used as placeholders for unknown character unicodes, instead of what would be expected when visually inspecting the text. The reason for these unsolved character unicode values is that the actual characters are glyphs that are embedded in the PDF document which use free unicode range for embedded fonts, not the right unicode. The only way to extract the valid text for those special characters is to use OCR at glyph level . This is our targeted main future enhancement, relying on a custom Deep Learning approach.

- map special characters in secondary fonts to their expected unicode 

- try to optimize speed and memory
