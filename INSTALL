Compiling pdfalto
--------------

pdfalto is written in C++ (with a little bit of C).  It should work with
any ANSI-compliant C++ and C compilers.  

The following notes give specific instructions for compiling on
different systems.



**************
***  UNIX  ***
**************

    pdfalto
        |- png 
        |- zlib 
        |- exe
        |- src
        |- xpdf
            |- fofi
            |- goo
            |- splash
            |- xpdf

        CMakeLists.txt
        

* Install libxml2 (Should be already installed on your linux distribution). See http://xmlsoft.org/
* Install libmotif

***  Win32  ***

Installation has been done using the above project organization:

    pdfalto
        |- exe
        |- src
        |- iconv-1.9.1.win32

            |- include
            |- lib

        |- libxml2-2.6.19+win32

            |- bin
            |- include

                |- libxml

            |- lib

        |- xpdf
            |- fofi
            |- goo
            |- splash
            |- xpdf

        CMakeLists.txt

With cygwin, the  procedure is(should be!) the same as for Unix

with MinGW

  * Download MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) at http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml

  * Open a DOS window.
  
  * update make.bat if necessary (paths)
   
  * ./make.bat



***********************
***  Win32/Eclipse  ***
***********************

With mingw:
  * Install the following libraries:
      libxml2-2.6.19+.win32, iconv-1.9.1.win32, zlib-1.2.3.win32: http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml
       
  * Download MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) at http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml
     * select MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe.
     * execute MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe to install MinGW.
     * add to the environment variable Path the directory bin which is the installation of MinGW-3.1.0-1 (for example : C:\MinGW\bin).
     * update the Makefile if necessary (CC, GCC and LIBPRO varaibles)

Eclipse configuration with mingw: 
	* Select Window > Preferences, C/C++/Make/New Make Project. 
	    * Select Make Builder: Unselect Use default and add the Build command as: mingw32-make.exe -k all
		* Select binary Parser: select PE Windows Parser
		* Select Discovery Options: 
			* select GCC per project scanner ino profile
			* COmpiler invocation command: mingw32-g++.exe
	* create the pdfalto project 
	* build your project
